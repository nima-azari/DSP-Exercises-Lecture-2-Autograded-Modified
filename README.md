# Exercise Lecture 2
Details: 
- Teacher: Ewout Bergsma
  - Email: e.bergsma@pl.hanze.nl
- Deadline: next class
- Students work individually

# Instructions
- Do not change anything in the `test` folder.
- Using `pip install -r requirements.txt` you can install all packages in one command.
- If you want to unittest your work (locally), simply use the command pytest
  - If you want to run a subset of the unittest: `pytest -k <subtring> -v` where you replace `<substring>` with (part of) the test name (test names can be found in the `test_assignment.py`)
- Do not have functions and variables of identical names within one Jupyter Notebook (this breaks the unittest and is bad practise)
- Open `exercises.ipynb` and follow the instructions there
